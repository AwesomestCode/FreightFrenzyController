## Welcome!

This is the public released version of Delbarton Robotics's (FTC Team #755) code from the 2021â€“2022 *FIRST* Tech Challenge Season "Freight Frenzy"!
Please feel free to look around for inspiration.

*Note: this code is intended as inspiratino. It will almost certainly not work on your robot unless you happened to design it exact the same as ours. So please don't try to install this code on your robot: at best, there will be a nasty error message, at worst, it could try driving a motor in a bad way and burn something out. Instead, if you have questions on how to implement similar functionality for your robot, feel free to ask!*
